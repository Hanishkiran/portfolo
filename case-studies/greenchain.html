                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    GreenChain is a fintech platform that helps financial institutions track and manage their 
                    financed emissions—the carbon footprint associated with their investment and lending portfolios. 
                    As co-founder and Product Manager, I led product development from concept to MVP, successfully 
                    raised funding, and built a product that addresses a critical need in sustainable finance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project demonstrated my ability to build products from scratch, navigate the startup 
                    ecosystem, raise funding, and work with prestigious accelerators. It also showcased my passion 
                    for sustainability tech and my ability to translate complex financial and environmental concepts 
                    into user-friendly products.

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>
                    Building GreenChain presented several unique challenges:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Complex Domain:</strong> Financed emissions tracking requires deep understanding 
                        of both finance and environmental science</li>
                    <li><strong>Regulatory Landscape:</strong> The field of sustainable finance is rapidly evolving 
                        with new regulations and standards</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Challenges:</strong> Tracking emissions across diverse investment portfolios 
                        requires aggregating data from multiple sources</li>
                    <li><strong>Market Education:</strong> Many potential customers were not yet aware of the need 
                        for financed emissions tracking</li>
                    <li><strong>Resource Constraints:</strong> As a startup, we had limited resources and needed 
                        to be strategic about what to build</li>
                    <li><strong>Funding:</strong> Needed to raise capital to build and scale the product</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Approach</h2>
                <h3>1. Market Research & Validation</h3>
                <p>
                    I conducted extensive market research to validate the opportunity:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Customer Interviews:</strong> Spoke with 50+ financial institutions to understand 
                        their needs and challenges around emissions tracking</li>
                    <li><strong>Competitive Analysis:</strong> Analyzed existing solutions to identify gaps and 
                        opportunities</li>
                    <li><strong>Regulatory Research:</strong> Studied emerging regulations (TCFD, SFDR, etc.) to 
                        understand compliance requirements</li>
                    <li><strong>Market Sizing:</strong> Estimated market size and growth potential</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This research validated that there was a significant, underserved market for financed emissions 
                    tracking tools.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Product Strategy & MVP Definition</h3>
                <p>
                    I defined the product strategy and MVP scope:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Value Proposition:</strong> Help financial institutions track, report, and reduce 
                        their financed emissions</li>
                    <li><strong>Core Features:</strong> Portfolio emissions calculation, reporting dashboards, 
                        compliance tracking, reduction recommendations</li>
                    <li><strong>MVP Scope:</strong> Focused on core emissions tracking and reporting to validate 
                        product-market fit</li>
                    <li><strong>Technical Architecture:</strong> Designed scalable architecture to handle diverse 
                        portfolio data</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Fundraising & Accelerator Programs</h3>
                <p>
                    I led fundraising efforts and participated in prestigious accelerator programs:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pitch Development:</strong> Created compelling pitch decks and investor materials</li>
                    <li><strong>Investor Meetings:</strong> Conducted 30+ investor meetings to raise capital</li>
                    <li><strong>Successfully Raised USD 75k:</strong> Secured funding from angel investors and 
                        early-stage funds</li>
                    <li><strong>Google Support:</strong> Received support and mentorship from Google</li>
                    <li><strong>Create-X Program:</strong> Participated in Georgia Tech's Create-X accelerator,

                        access to mentors, investors, and partners</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These programs provided not just funding, but also valuable mentorship, network access, and 
                    credibility in the startup ecosystem.
                </p>

                <h3>4. Product Development</h3>
                <p>
                    I led product development from concept to MVP:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Requirements Definition:</strong> Created detailed PRDs for all MVP features</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Integration:</strong> Worked with engineering team to integrate data from

                        feedback and iterate</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5. Go-to-Market Strategy</h3>
                <p>
                    I developed and executed go-to-market strategy:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Customer Acquisition:</strong> Identified and reached out to target customers</li>
                    <li><strong>Partnership Development:</strong> Built partnerships with data providers and

                <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
                <p>
                    This startup experience taught me invaluable lessons:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Startup Experience is Valuable:</strong> Building a product from scratch teaches 
                        skills that are valuable in any product role—resourcefulness, prioritization, and customer 
                        focus</li>
                    <li><strong>Fundraising is a Product:</strong> Raising capital requires the same skills as 
                        building products—understanding customer (investor) needs, clear communication, and 
                        demonstrating value</li>
                    <li><strong>Accelerators Provide More Than Money:</strong> The mentorship, network, and 
                        resources from accelerators are often more valuable than the funding</li>
                    <li><strong>Domain Expertise Matters:</strong> Deep understanding of the problem domain 
                        (sustainable finance) was essential for building a credible product</li>
                    <li><strong>Customer Development is Continuous:</strong> In a new market, continuous customer 
                        development is essential to understand evolving needs</li>
                    <li><strong>Passion Drives Persistence:</strong> Building a startup is hard—passion for the 
                        problem and mission is essential for persistence</li>
                </ul>
