                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Infinidi is a gaming platform that connects gamers, game developers, and gaming communities 
                    in a decentralized ecosystem. As Product Manager, I led the MVP development from concept to 
                    launch, conducting extensive user research with over 1,000 gamers to ensure we built a product 
                    that truly addressed user needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project showcased my ability to combine user research, product strategy, and technical 
                    execution to build products that resonate with users. The MVP successfully validated core 
                    product hypotheses and established a foundation for future platform growth.

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>
                    Building a gaming platform MVP presented several challenges:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Understanding User Needs:</strong> The gaming ecosystem is diverse—we needed to 
                        understand what different segments of gamers actually wanted</li>
                    <li><strong>Defining MVP Scope:</strong> With limited resources, we needed to identify the 
                        minimum set of features that would deliver value</li>
                    <li><strong>Technical Complexity:</strong> Building a platform that connects multiple stakeholders 
                        (gamers, developers, communities) required careful architecture decisions</li>
                    <li><strong>Competitive Landscape:</strong> The gaming platform space is crowded—we needed to 
                        differentiate through user experience and unique value propositions</li>
                    <li><strong>Rapid Iteration:</strong> Gaming is a fast-moving industry—we needed to move quickly 
                        while maintaining quality</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Approach</h2>
                <h3>1. Comprehensive User Research</h3>
                <p>
                    I conducted extensive user research to understand the gaming ecosystem:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1,000+ User Interviews:</strong> Conducted structured interviews with gamers across 
                        different segments (casual, competitive, indie developers, streamers)</li>
                    <li><strong>Survey Analysis:</strong> Distributed surveys to gather quantitative data on gaming 
                        habits, platform preferences, and pain points</li>
                    <li><strong>Competitive Analysis:</strong> Analyzed existing gaming platforms to identify gaps 
                        and opportunities</li>
                    <li><strong>User Personas:</strong> Created detailed personas based on research findings to guide 
                        product decisions</li>
                    <li><strong>Journey Mapping:</strong> Mapped user journeys to identify friction points and 
                        opportunities for improvement</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This research revealed key insights:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gamers wanted better ways to discover indie games and connect with developers</li>
                    <li>Game developers needed more direct channels to reach their audience</li>
                    <li>Gaming communities wanted tools to organize events and tournaments</li>
                    <li>There was demand for a platform that rewarded both creators and players</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. MVP Scope Definition</h3>
                <p>
                    Based on user research, I defined the MVP scope using a structured prioritization framework:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Core Features:</strong> User profiles, game discovery, basic community features</li>
                    <li><strong>Must-Have Integrations:</strong> Authentication, payment processing, game library 
                        connections</li>
                    <li><strong>Nice-to-Have (Post-MVP):</strong> Advanced tournament features, streaming integration, 
                        advanced analytics</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I created detailed product requirements documents (PRDs) in Notion, including user stories, 
                    acceptance criteria, and technical specifications.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Test Case Development</h3>
                <p>
                    I worked closely with QA engineers to develop comprehensive test cases:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Functional Testing:</strong> Test cases for all core user flows (signup, game 
                        discovery, community creation)</li>
                    <li><strong>Integration Testing:</strong> Test cases for third-party integrations (payment, 
                        authentication, game APIs)</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance Testing:</strong> Test cases to ensure platform could handle expected 
                        user load</li>
                    <li><strong>User Acceptance Testing:</strong> Test cases based on user research findings to 
                        validate product meets user needs</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This rigorous testing approach ensured the MVP was stable and met user expectations at launch.
                </p>

                <h3>4. Sprint Workflow & Agile Delivery</h3>
                <p>
                    I established and facilitated Agile workflows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sprint Planning:</strong> 2-week sprints with clear goals and deliverables</li>
                    <li><strong>Daily Standups:</strong> Ensured team alignment and quick issue resolution</li>
                    <li><strong>Sprint Reviews:</strong> Demoed progress to stakeholders and gathered feedback</li>
                    <li><strong>Retrospectives:</strong> Continuously improved team processes and velocity</li>
                    <li><strong>Backlog Management:</strong> Prioritized features based on user research insights 
                        and business value</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I used Jira to track all user stories, bugs, and tasks, ensuring visibility across the team.
                </p>

                <h3>5. Design & UX</h3>
                <p>
                    I collaborated with designers to create user-centered designs:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Created wireframes in Figma based on user research findings</li>
                    <li>Conducted usability testing with target users</li>
                    <li>Iterated on designs based on feedback</li>
                    <li>Ensured designs were accessible and responsive</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <p>
                    The MVP launch delivered significant value:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Validated Product-Market Fit:</strong> User research and MVP launch validated that 
                        there was demand for the platform</li>
                    <li><strong>Established Foundation:</strong> MVP provided a solid foundation for future feature 
                        development</li>
                    <li><strong>User Engagement:</strong> Early users provided valuable feedback that informed 
                        product roadmap</li>
                    <li><strong>Team Alignment:</strong> Clear scope and test cases ensured all team members were 
                        aligned on goals</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
