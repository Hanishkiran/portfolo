                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>
                        I'm a Product Manager with 4 years of experience building products that matter. 
                        My journey spans government tech, fintech, AI platforms, and sustainability solutions—always 
                        with a focus on data-driven decision making and user-centric design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I'm leading product delivery at Zenika for GIC's performance management platform, 
                        where I've improved data integrity, optimized observability, and automated workflows. My 
                        unique strength lies in bridging technical complexity with business outcomes—I speak both 
                        the language of engineers and stakeholders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What sets me apart? I combine deep technical certifications (SQL, Python) with proven 
                        enterprise delivery experience. I've conducted user research with 1,000+ users, achieved 
                        100% compliance across government agencies, and built products from MVP to scale. I'm not 
                        just managing products—I'm building the technical infrastructure and data platforms that 
                        power them.

                <h2>My Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    My path to product management wasn't linear—it was driven by curiosity about how technology 
                    can solve real problems. I was extremely interested in building 0 to 1 products based on user needs. Starting with a foundation in business and data analytics, I quickly realized 
                    that the best products come from understanding both the technical possibilities and the human 
                    needs behind them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At GIC, I've learned what it takes to deliver enterprise-grade features with detailed testing. At Affinidi, I discovered the power of deep user research in building products 
                    that people actually want. And through my startup experience with GreenChain, I've experienced 
                    the full lifecycle—from ideation to fundraising to building.
                </p>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>What I'm Looking For</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm seeking opportunities as a <strong>Technical Product Manager</strong> or <strong>Product Manager</strong> 
                    focused on AI, Data Platforms, or Enterprise SaaS. I'm particularly interested in roles at:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Top Tech Companies:</strong> Meta, Google, Microsoft and other AI-first organizations</li>
                    <li><strong>Government Digital Agencies:</strong> GIC, GovTech, NCS—where I can continue building 
                        products that serve public good</li>
                    <li><strong>Data-Driven Product Teams:</strong> DBS, fintech companies, and high-growth SaaS startups 
                        where data is core to the product</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I thrive in environments where technical depth meets strategic thinking, where I can work with 
                    talented engineers and designers to build products that scale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am also looking to meet like-minded product managers with a passion to build products that meet customer needs, and industry thought leaders in AI, fintech, sustainability and other industries.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>My Approach</h2>
                <h3>Data-Driven Decision Making</h3>
                <p>
                    Every product decision I make is backed by data. Whether it's SQL queries to understand user 
                    behavior, Python scripts to analyze metrics, or Tableau dashboards to track compliance—I use 
                    data to validate assumptions and measure impact.
                </p>

                <h3>User Empathy & Research</h3>
                <p>
                    I've conducted research with 1,000+ users because I believe great products start with deep 
                    understanding. I don't just build features—I solve real problems that users face every day.
                </p>

                <h3>Technical Fluency</h3>
                <p>
                    While I'm not a full-time engineer, I'm certified in SQL and Python, comfortable with React.js 
                    and Node.js, and have hands-on experience with Datadog, Jira automation, and API integrations. 
                    This technical fluency allows me to have meaningful conversations with engineering teams and 
                    make informed architectural decisions.
                </p>

                <h3>Enterprise Delivery</h3>
                <p>
                    I understand what it takes to deliver products in enterprise environments—managing stakeholders, 
                    ensuring compliance, building for scale, and maintaining high uptime. I've achieved 100% IM8 
                    compliance and maintained 95%+ uptime across multiple products.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Beyond Work</h2>
                <p>
                    When I'm not building products, I'm learning. I stay current with AI/ML trends, like how I vibe coded this website using Cursor AI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm also passionate about sustainability tech—as evidenced by my co-founding of GreenChain, 
                    where we built tools to track financed emissions and help organizations make more sustainable 
                    financial decisions.
